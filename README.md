# Extended Vision Arm

This is the final analytical project for the course Foundations of Robotics (EE238a). 


_Abstractâ€”The purpose of this paper is to show the detailed analysis of a vision extending robotic arm in an RRPR configuration. The Forward Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics, Velocity Kinematics, Statics, and Dynamics are all derived through a combination of hand calculations and programmable algorithms created in MATLAB. All but the Dynamics formulations were successfully derived and example values are illustrated for numerical results._
